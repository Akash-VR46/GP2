Known Issues
============
The isomorphism filter isn't working properly. This is most evident when running
inverse-prog: all output graphs are isomorphic but it outputs them all to separate
files. I *think* this happens because I do not perform an isomorphism check on the final
list of output graphs. Currently isomorphism checking is performed after each
rule application (line 94 of RunProgram.hs). Either that or the isomorphism 
checker doesn't work properly. Or both.

The acyclic program is not interpreted correctly. It outputs a "yes" node on
acyclic-graph2.txt despite the fact that the graph is a cycle. This might be 
because it doesn't properly evaluate the indeg (n1) = 0 condition in the
delete rule.

The 2-colouring program has a rule with bidirectional edges but I do not believe 
we ever wrote code to handle bidirectional edges during graph matching and rule
application.
