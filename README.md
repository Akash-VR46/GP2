GP2: Graph Programming
================================

GP2 is a graph programming language. Programs require two text files: one containing a set of graph transformation rules, and the other containing a starting _host graph_ to which these rules are applied. These text files can be prepared in a conventional text editor, or exported from a specialised graphical editor. Rule/host pairs may be executed either by passing them to an interpreter, or by compiling to native code.


Compiler
========

There is currently a lexer, a parser, a semantic analyser and a pretty printer. The first two components are generated by Flex and Bison respectively. The semantic analyser is written in C. The pretty printing module is used for debugging. It outputs abstract syntax trees in the DOT language, to be visualised with graphviz, and prints a textual representation of the symbol table to a \*.tab file.

The code contains a fully functional parser and semantic analyser for GP2 programs. There is also a code generator, currently capable of generating a C module for each rule in a GP2 program and a module to build the host graph.


Build Instructions
---------------------

To build an executable for a GP2 program, run:

> make all F1=path/to/gp2_program_file F2=path/to/host_graph_file

To execute only the parser and code generator, run:

> make compile 
> ./GP2-compile path/to/gp_program_file path/to/gp_graph_file

To execute only the runtime system, run:

> make runtime ./GP2-run
> ./GP2-run


Haskell
=======

The Haskell subdirectory contains a reference interpreter for GP2 implemented in Haskell, a compiler that generates OILR Machine instructions (see below), and several ancillary tools for viewing and testing GP2 host graphs.

Typing `make` in the Haskell directory produces the following binaries:

`gp2`: The GP2 reference interpreter.

`gp2c`: The OILR machine compiler, which generates a C file that can be compiled and linked against the OILR Machine runtime.

`ViewGraph`: A host graph visualiser (using GraphViz as a back-end).

`IsoChecker`: A standalone host graph comparison tool, which checks whether two host graphs are isomorphic.



OilrMachine
===========

The OILR machine is a specialised graph language abstract machine.


Build instructions (basic graph data structure)
-----------------------------------------------

Typing `make` in the OilrMachine directory builds the OILR runtime, `oilrrt.a` using a simplistic graph representation.


Build instructions (full graph data structure)
-----------------------------------------------

To build the OILR runtime using the full graph data structure:

> make -f Makefile.gp2


Compiling GP2 programs
----------------------

Compile a GP2 program to C:

> gp2c prog.gp2 graph.host


To compile a GP2 program generated by `gp2c`, you will need the runtime static library, and the two header files `oilrrt.h` and `oilrinst.h`. 

> gcc -o prog prog.c oilrrt.a
