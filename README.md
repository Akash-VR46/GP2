GP2: Graph Programming
================================

GP2 is a graph programming language. The programmer creates graph programs in a graphical editor, which are executed by an underlying machine. The editor generates two text files: one representing the program and one representing the input graph. The program is compiled to native code (one day) and the input graph is converted to a machine readable format.

There is a lexer, a parser, a semantic analyser and a pretty printer. The first two components are generated by Flex and Bison respectively. The semantic analyser is written in C. The pretty printing module is used for debugging. It outputs abstract syntax trees in the DOT language, to be visualised with graphviz, and prints the symbol table in textual form to a *.tab file.

Build Instructions
---------------------
To build the executable, run:

> make

To build the executable and automatically run it on extensionless input files, run:

> make runGP path/to/gp_program_file path/to/gp_graph_file

There is also a debugging option which automatically runs the executable with valgrind:

> make debug path/to/gp_program_file path/to/gp_graph_file
