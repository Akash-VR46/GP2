GP2: Graph Programming
================================

GP2 is a graph programming language. The programmer creates graph programs in a graphical editor which are executed by an underlying machine. The editor generates two text files passed to the compiler: one representing the program and one representing the input graph.

There is currently a lexer, a parser, a semantic analyser and a pretty printer. The first two components are generated by Flex and Bison respectively. The semantic analyser is written in C. The pretty printing module is used for debugging. It outputs abstract syntax trees in the DOT language, to be visualised with graphviz, and prints a textual representation of the symbol table to a *.tab file.

Build Instructions
---------------------
To build an executable GP2 parser _parseGP_, run:

> make parseGP

To build the executable and run it on extensionless input files, run:

> make parseGP-run path/to/gp_program_file path/to/gp_graph_file

There is also a debugging option which runs the executable with valgrind:

> make parseGP-debug path/to/gp_program_file path/to/gp_graph_file
