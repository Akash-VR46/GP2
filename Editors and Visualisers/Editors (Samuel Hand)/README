Building the project requires Elm.

To build simply run `elm make src/Main.elm --output docs/main.js; elm make src/Rule.elm --output docs/rule.js`.

Once built simply start a web server of your choice with docs as the root directory, and point a browser at it to start using the graph editor. The rule editor is accessible at the /rule subdirectory.

All the code was developed by Samuel Hand, except dist/full.render.js and dist/viz.js, which are both part of the viz.js JavaScript library.
