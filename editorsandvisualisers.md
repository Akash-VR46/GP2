# Samuel Hand's Editors

These are web-based GP 2 graph and rule editors. They can import and export `.dot` files as well as GP 2's own `.host` and `.rule` files.

- **Create edge:** right click and drag from source to target
- **Select item:** left click item
- **Delete selected item:** press delete on keyboard
- **Zoom in/out:** mouse wheel up/down
- **Pan:** left click and drag background

These editors were made as part of Samuel Hand's BSc degree, the report of which can be found <a href="Editors and Visualisers/Editors (Samuel Hand)/A_Graphical_Editor_For_GP2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Timothy Atkinson's Visualisers

These are web-based GP 2 graph and rule visualisers. The textual form of a GP 2 graph/rule is entered in a text box and an image is generated. However, the visualisers do not support rooted nodes or bidirectional edges.

# Ivaylo Hristakiev's and Alex Elliott's Editor

This is an integrated developping environment for GP 2, and an application meant to be compiled on Linux. It has not been worked on in years, so there is no guarantee that it works with the current compiler.
