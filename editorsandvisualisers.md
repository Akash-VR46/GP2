# Samuel Hand's Editors

These are web-based GP 2 graph and rule editors. They can import and export `.dot` files as well as GP 2's own `.host` and `.rule` files.

- **Create edge:** right click and drag from source to target
- **Select item:** left click item
- **Delete selected item:** press delete on keyboard
- **Zoom in/out:** mouse wheel up/down
- **Pan:** left click and drag background

These editors were made as part of Samuel Hand's BSc degree, the report of which can be found <a href="https://github.com/UoYCS-plasma/GP2-Editor/blob/gh-pages/project.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Timothy Atkinson's Visualisers

These are web-based GP 2 graph and rule visualisers. The textual form of a GP 2 graph/rule is entered in a text box and an image is generated. However, the visualisers do not support rooted nodes or bidirectional edges.
