To set up the compiler, follow these steps:

1. Move these files to a directory of your choice.
1. In the ``gp2c`` file, edit the variable ``install_dir`` at the top to be the path to said directory.
1. Make ``gp2c`` executable by running the command ``chmod u+x gp2c`` as a root user.

If you're on Ubuntu, you can move ``gp2c`` to your home folder to make it available as a terminal command.
